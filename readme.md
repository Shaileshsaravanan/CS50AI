# CS50â€™s Introduction to AI with Python ðŸš€

Welcome to my journey through CS50â€™s Introduction to AI with Python! This course takes a deep dive into the concepts and algorithms that form the foundation of modern artificial intelligence. From game-playing engines to handwriting recognition and machine translation, we explore the ideas behind these technologies and learn how to incorporate them into our own Python programs. By the end of the course, we'll not only gain experience with machine learning libraries but also develop the knowledge to design intelligent systems of our own.

## Notes

Throughout the lectures, I've taken notes on key concepts and algorithms that was covered. Here's a glimpse of what I've learned:

## Week 0: Search

### Concepts
- **Agent**: An entity that perceives its environment and takes action based on that perception.
- **State**: A configuration of the agent and its environment.
- **Actions**: Choices that can be made in a given state.
- **Transition model**: A description of the state resulting from performing any applicable action.
- **Path cost**: A numerical cost associated with a specific path.
- **Evaluation function**: A function that estimates the expected utility of a game from a given state.

### Algorithms
- **DFS** (depth-first search): Explores the deepest node in the frontier first.
- **BFS** (breadth-first search): Explores the shallowest node in the frontier first.
- **Greedy best-first search**: Expands the node that is closest to the goal, based on an estimated heuristic function.
- **A\* search**: Expands the node with the lowest value of "cost to reach node" plus "estimated goal cost."
- **Minimax**: An adversarial search algorithm.
